This script defines prompts for an AI agent and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

get_character_prompt: Defines the AI agent's behavior, guiding interactions and tool invocation.
get_context_prompt: Selects relevant database collections for responding to Power BI report queries.
report_prompts: Prompts for getting a markdown format report, sumarized and extensive format.

def get_character_prompt() -> str:
    """
    Generates the character prompt for the agent, including the available tools.

    This prompt is sourced from the LangChain library, specifically from the
    `hwchase17/react-chat` model on the Smith platform (https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react-chat).
    It is designed for creating a conversational agent (chatbot) that interacts with users
    in a natural and coherent manner, while also allowing the use of external tools if necessary.
    The agent decides whether to use a tool based on the context of the conversation and generates
    responses accordingly.

    The prompt follows a structured format where the assistant can evaluate whether to use a tool,
    execute the corresponding action, and respond with the result. If no tool is needed, the assistant
    simply provides the answer directly to the user. The format includes placeholders for tools,
    conversation history, new input, and the agent's scratchpad to guide its reasoning process.

    Returns:
        str: The character prompt, ready for use with the conversational agent.

    Example usage:
        character_prompt = get_character_prompt()

def get_context_prompt(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns the context analysis prompt for collection selection in a RAG architecture.

    This function generates a dynamic prompt that assists in determining which collections
    should be used to provide the most accurate context for a given query within a
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The collections are optimized for different
    types of data in a database that contains information about Power BI reports, including
    dashboards, pages, charts, tables, KPIs, and more.

    The prompt is structured to help the system evaluate the user's query and decide which
    collection(s) to retrieve, based on the level of detail required for the query. The
    available collections are:

    - **report_names**: Report names, ideal for queries that require only report titles.
    - **element_names**: Index of elements in each report, useful for schema or element existence checks.
    - **upload_dates**: Dates when reports were updated, for queries about report update history.
    - **Report Summaries**: Concise summaries of individual reports, ideal for high-level overviews.
    - **Elements**: Detailed data on individual report components like charts, tables, and KPIs.
    - **Text Pages**: Complete text data from report pages, useful for in-depth section or page queries.

    The prompt outlines a sequential decision-making flow for selecting the minimal, most relevant
    collections to answer the query effectively. The process proceeds through a series of steps,
    where each step refines the selection of collections based on the user's query and its information needs.

    Args:
        query (str): The query string that the system needs to process and analyze for context selection.

    Returns:
        str: A formatted prompt string, ready to be used in a RAG system to determine the best collection(s).

    Example usage:
        context_prompt = get_context_prompt("When were the reports last updated?")

    Example Output:
        {
            "collections": [{"name": "upload_dates", "n": 10}]
        }

    The prompt will guide the system through the following steps:
    1. Assess the high-level information need (e.g., just report names or more detailed data).
    2. Determine if the query requires specific element names, upload dates, or other types of details.
    3. Based on the evaluation, the appropriate collections will be selected and the number of documents
       needed from each collection will be estimated.

    **Only the resulting JSON object should be returned without any additional explanation or text.**
